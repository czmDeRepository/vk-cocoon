# vk-cocoon

Virtual Kubelet provider that maps Kubernetes pods to
[Cocoon](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cocoon) MicroVMs.

One vk-cocoon process runs per node. It satisfies the
[virtual-kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet)
provider contract by translating pod CRUD into `cocoon` CLI calls and
pushing per-VM status back to the kubelet.

**Documentation: [cocoonstack.github.io/vk-cocoon](https://cocoonstack.github.io/vk-cocoon/)** (source in [`docs/`](docs/)).

```
Kubernetes API ──► virtual-kubelet provider (vk-cocoon, one per node)
   pod CRUD    ──► CreatePod / DeletePod / UpdatePod ── cocoon clone/run/snapshot
   status      ◄── async notify ── per-pod probe loop + real-time VM event watcher
   snapshots   ──► Puller / Pusher ── OCI registry (cross-node hibernate/wake)
```

## Architecture

| Layer | Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Application | `package main` | Entry point, node registration, metrics server, VM event watcher startup |
| Provider | `provider/cocoon/` | Lifecycle methods, startup reconcile, orphan policy, VM event watcher, pod eviction |
| Provider iface | `provider/` | Shared provider interface and node-capacity helpers |
| Cocoon CLI | `vm/` | `Runtime` interface + the `CocoonCLI` that shells out to `cocoon` |
| Snapshot SDK | `snapshots/` | `Puller` / `Pusher` stream snapshots and cloud images to an OCI registry |
| Network | `network/` | cocoon-net lease parser + the ICMPv4 `Pinger` the probe loop uses |
| Guest console | `guest/` | SAC dialer for Windows static IP |
| Probes | `probes/` | Per-pod probe agents that keep the async provider's pushed status live |
| Metrics | `metrics/` | Prometheus collectors for lifecycle, snapshots, VM table, orphans |

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the full layer map and the
async-provider contract.

## macOS guests

Pods annotated `cocoonset.cocoonstack.io/os: macos` dispatch to the standalone
[cocoon-macos](https://github.com/cocoonstack/cocoon-macos) QEMU/KVM backend
(`VK_COCOON_MACOS_BIN`, default `/usr/local/bin/cocoon-macos`) instead of the
cocoon CLI. The guest joins the cocoon CNI plane for a DHCP'd routed IP;
readiness is the guest's sshd answering on that IP. The QEMU VNC framebuffer
gets a node-unique, password-protected host port allocated by vk-cocoon and
published via `vm.cocoonstack.io/vnc-port`. A vk-cocoon restart adopts a live guest
instead of relaunching it (two QEMU processes on one overlay corrupt the
disk). Hibernate/wake, fork, and snapshot push do not apply to macOS guests.

## Quick start

vk-cocoon is a host-level binary installed via a systemd unit:

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 ./vk-cocoon /usr/local/bin/vk-cocoon
sudo install -m 0644 packaging/vk-cocoon.service /etc/systemd/system/vk-cocoon.service
sudo install -m 0644 packaging/vk-cocoon.env.example /etc/cocoon/vk-cocoon.env
# edit /etc/cocoon/vk-cocoon.env, then:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now vk-cocoon
```

Full steps in [Installation](docs/installation.md).
